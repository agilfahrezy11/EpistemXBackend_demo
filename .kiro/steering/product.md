# Project Overview

## Epistem Land Cover Mapping Platform Demo

A Streamlit-based web application for land cover mapping using Google Earth Engine python API. This product is a prototype version of EPISTEM-x mapping platform, providing overview of the features in the platform. This platform also provides an interactive interface for generating image mosaics, classification schemes, ROI analysis, and thematic accuracy assessment. 

### Key Features
- **Module 1**: Generate Landsat image mosaics for specified areas and time periods
- **Module 2**: Classification scheme development
- **Module 4**: Region of Interest (ROI) analysis  
- **Module 6**: Land Cover classification and creation
- **Module 7**: Thematic accuracy assessment

### Target Users
Multiple sectors and stakeholders with different level knowledge working with satellite imagery for land cover mapping and environmental monitoring.

### Data Sources
- Landsat 1-9 Collection 2 Tier 1 ARD via Google Earth Engine
- Thermal bands support using TOA collection (Landsat 5-9)
- Spatial resolutions: 60m (Landsat 1-3), 30m (Landsat 4-9)
- Area of Interest (AOI) and Region of Interest (ROI) from user
