# Repository Structure Review

This document provides a review of the repository's structure and offers a recommended layout based on our discussion and standard Python project conventions.

## Current State Analysis

The repository has evolved significantly and now has a good foundation, including:
- A `pages` directory for the Streamlit multi-page app.
- A `home.py` acting as the main entry point.
- A `src/epistemx` directory containing the core logic as a Python package with a flat file structure.

This is a great setup for a functional application that prioritizes simplicity and ease of navigation.

## Recommended Structure

Based on your preference for a straightforward layout, the following structure is recommended. It is clean, effective, and ideal for projects where a flat hierarchy is desired.

```
epistemx-backend/
├── .gitignore
├── home.py
├── environment.yml
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── notebooks/
│   ├── 1_data_exploration.ipynb
│   └── 2_model_training.ipynb
├── pages/
│   ├── 1_Generate_Mosaic.py
│   └── 2_Analyze_ROI.py
├── src/
│   └── epistemx/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── helpers.py
│       ├── module_1.py
│       ├── module_2.py
│       └── ... (and so on)
└── tests/
    └── test_helpers.py
```

### Justification for this Structure:

- **Easy to Manage:** A flat package structure inside `src/` is simple to understand, reduces boilerplate, and makes finding files quick and intuitive.
- **Clear Separation:** It maintains a clear separation between the Streamlit UI (`home.py`, `pages/`), exploratory code (`notebooks/`), and the core library (`src/epistemx/`).
- **Aligns with Workflow:** This structure is perfectly suited for a workflow that leverages the Google Earth Engine API for data and modeling, as it avoids unnecessary directories for local data or models.

## Future Considerations

This structure should serve the project well for the foreseeable future. If, down the line, the number of modules in `src/epistemx` becomes very large, you might consider grouping them into sub-packages (e.g., `src/epistemx/gee/` for all GEE-related code). However, for now, the current flat structure is optimal.
