Understood! I will thoroughly research community best practices for structuring Python GitHub repositories, specifically for land use land cover classification using the Earth Engine Python API. I'll review your current repository setup and compare it to the notable examples you've provided. I'll identify common organizational patterns and improvements, focusing on future-proof project structure, code modularization with Python files, implementation notebooks, and potential Streamlit integration. I'll return with a detailed analysis and suggestions to improve your repository layout for long-term maintainability.





Here is how you can arrange a future‑proof GitHub repository for a Land‑Use/Land‑Cover (LULC) classifier built with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API.  The recommendations below combine widely‑accepted Python project conventions, the cookiecutter data‑science template, and patterns observed in your example repositories.



\## 1. Establish a clean top‑level structure



When a new contributor lands on your project page, they see only the top‑level files.  The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python notes that a repository should not look like a “massive dump of files”; instead it should have a clear hierarchy.  A minimal Python repository usually contains a README, license, setup file, requirements and a package directory:



```

project-root/

│

├── README.md             # overview of the project and quick‑start instructions

├── LICENSE               # legal terms (e.g., GPLv3 or MIT):contentReference\[oaicite:2]{index=2}

├── setup.py or pyproject.toml # packaging and installation metadata:contentReference\[oaicite:3]{index=3}

├── requirements.txt or environment.yml # dependency list:contentReference\[oaicite:4]{index=4}

├── .gitignore            # ignore data, checkpoints, temporary files

├── .pre-commit-config.yaml (optional) # pre‑commit hooks for formatting/linting

├── <package\_name>/       # importable Python package with \_\_init\_\_.py:contentReference\[oaicite:5]{index=5}

│   ├── \_\_init\_\_.py

│   ├── data/             # modules for loading/downloading data (GEE and local)

│   ├── features/         # feature‑engineering functions

│   ├── models/           # model architectures and training logic

│   ├── ee/               # wrappers for Earth Engine tasks (e.g. export imagery, mosaic functions)

│   ├── utils/            # utility functions (metrics, plotting, logging)

│   └── ... (other modules/classes)

├── notebooks/            # Jupyter notebooks demonstrating workflows

├── scripts/              # CLI scripts for training/evaluation

├── data/                 # small, version‑controlled example datasets (never raw imagery)

│   ├── raw/              # sample raw data or links to external storage

│   └── processed/        # processed data generated during pipelines

├── models/               # saved model checkpoints (small models; large models via Git LFS)

├── streamlit\_app/        # code for the Streamlit UI (to be added later)

├── tests/                # unit/integration tests

├── docs/ or wiki/        # optional Sphinx or MkDocs documentation

└── Makefile or task runner (optional)  # convenience commands (e.g., `make test`, `make lint`)

```



\### Why this works



\* \*\*Module placement\*\* – The Python guide stresses that your module should be easily importable from a directory like `sample/` and not hidden in ambiguous locations.  Placing the core code under a single package (e.g., `lulc\_classifier/` or `src/`) makes it importable in notebooks and scripts and enables packaging.

\* \*\*Top‑level metadata\*\* – Keeping the `README`, `LICENSE` and `requirements` at the root makes them visible to users.  The license clarifies usage rights, and a requirements/environment file ensures reproducible environments.

\* \*\*Notebooks separate from package\*\* – Notebooks are powerful for exploration but not meant to be imported.  Putting them in `notebooks/` prevents accidental imports and allows version‑control of outputs (strip output before committing).

\* \*\*Data directories\*\* – The cookiecutter data‑science template shows that projects often separate `inputs/data` and `outputs/data` into subfolders.  For GEE projects, include only small sample datasets in `data/raw/` or provide scripts to download data from the public dataset or asset, because Earth‑Engine datasets are large.

\* \*\*Scripts\*\* – Provide command‑line entry points (e.g., `train.py`, `evaluate.py`, `predict.py`) under `scripts/`.  Keep them thin; they should import functions from the package.

\* \*\*Tests\*\* – A `tests/` directory encourages test‑driven development.  The Python guide recommends starting with simple test files and expanding as needed.

\* \*\*Documentation\*\* – Using a `docs/` folder (with Sphinx/MkDocs) makes it easier to host API documentation.  Cookiecutter DS templates include `docs/` and `analysis/notebooks` to encourage reproducible research.

\* \*\*Environment and pre‑commit\*\* – Including `environment.yml` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (e.g., ruff/black/flake8 hooks) helps others replicate your environment and enforces consistent style.



\## 2. Pattern synthesis from notable LULC repositories



The example repositories you listed illustrate several patterns worth adopting:



| Example repository                                  | Key structural features                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Lessons                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| \*\*SSLTransformerRS\*\* (self‑supervised Transformers) | Top‑level `Transformer\_SSL/` package with subfolders `configs`, `data`, `models`, plus training scripts (`train\_evaluation.py`) and demo notebooks.  Configuration files live in a separate `configs` directory and Jupyter notebooks are stored in `demo/`.                                                                                    | Keep model/config code separate from examples; store config hyper‑parameters in JSON/YAML; provide demonstration notebooks under a dedicated folder.                                                   |

| \*\*land\_cover\_classification\_unet\*\*                  | Uses `unet/` (model architecture) and `utils/` packages, with top‑level scripts `train.py`, `predict.py`, `eval.py` and `diceloss.py`; `data/` holds sample data, `checkpoints/` holds saved models; `requirements.txt` and `README.md` describe usage.                                                                                         | Provide modular code for models and utilities; separate training and inference scripts; maintain directories for data and saved checkpoints.                                                           |

| \*\*VegMapper\*\*                                       | Organizes code into separate subpackages (`gee`, `classifier`, `stacks`, `vegmapper`), uses `environment.yml` and `setup.py` for packaging; includes `binder/` and `calval/` for reproducible environments and calibration/validation; many notebooks for installation and AWS instructions; docs include `CLOUD.md` and installation notebook. | Use a proper package with installation script (`setup.py`/`pyproject.toml`) and environment file; provide documentation and installation notebooks; separate geospatial (GEE) functions into a module. |

| \*\*MTLCC\*\*                                           | Contains `modelzoo/` for different models, `utils/`, `doc/` for documentation and evaluation notebooks; includes `Dataset.py` for dataset handling, `S2parser.py` for Sentinel‑2 data, a Dockerfile and shell scripts for building and evaluation.                                                                                              | When multiple architectures are supported, group them into a `modelzoo/` module; provide dataset parsers; include scripts and a Dockerfile for reproducibility.                                        |

| \*\*Hyperspectral\*\*                                   | Primarily composed of Jupyter notebooks with accompanying Python scripts (e.g., `IndianPinesCNN.py`); separate `images/` for figures and `Spatial\_dataset.py` for data loading.                                                                                                                                                                 | Notebooks are useful for research but should be backed by importable Python modules; keep figures and dataset loaders in separate folders.                                                             |



\## 3. Suggestions tailored to your LULC classifier



1\. \*\*Name your package\*\* – Use a descriptive package name (`lulc\_classifier` or `parsimonious\_lulc`).  Inside, create modules such as:



&nbsp;  \* `data/gee\_handler.py` – functions to authenticate with GEE, fetch imagery, apply cloud masking and export training patches.

&nbsp;  \* `models/earth\_encoder.py` – classes implementing your classifier (e.g., random forest, CNN, transformer).

&nbsp;  \* `features/feature\_engineering.py` – indices (NDVI, EVI, MNDWI) and other feature extraction.

&nbsp;  \* `utils/metrics.py`, `utils/logger.py`, `utils/plotting.py`.



&nbsp;  These modules can be imported by notebooks and scripts.  Avoid putting heavy logic inside Jupyter notebooks; treat notebooks as thin examples.



2\. \*\*Configuration management\*\* – Use a `configs/` folder with YAML/JSON/INI files to store hyper‑parameters, file paths and Earth‑Engine parameters.  This makes it easier to reproduce experiments and supports cross‑validation.



3\. \*\*Environment \& dependencies\*\* – Provide a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` listing Earth‑Engine (`earthengine-api`), geemap, geopandas, rasterio, scikit‑learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch and streamlit.  A pinned environment file makes your work reproducible.



4\. \*\*Data handling\*\* – Do not include large remote‑sensing datasets in the repository.  Instead provide scripts to download from Google Earth Engine or external sources.  For example, include a `data/download\_data.py` script that exports training tiles using GEE API.  Sample tiles (e.g., small GeoTIFFs) can go in `data/raw/` for demonstration.



5\. \*\*Notebooks\*\* – Keep notebooks in `notebooks/` and strip outputs before committing.  Provide notebooks such as:



&nbsp;  \* `01\_data\_exploration.ipynb` – exploring GEE tiles and computing statistics.

&nbsp;  \* `02\_training.ipynb` – training the model using functions from your package.

&nbsp;  \* `03\_evaluation.ipynb` – assessing performance and visualising confusion matrices.



6\. \*\*Streamlit UI\*\* – When you add the UI, create a `streamlit\_app/` folder or `app.py`.  It should import functions from your package (e.g., data loading and prediction) and maintain its own configuration (e.g., default region of interest).  Provide a separate `requirements\_streamlit.txt` or note in the README about additional dependencies (streamlit, folium).



7\. \*\*Documentation\*\* – Write a thorough `README.md` describing the problem, data sources, installation, usage and citation.  Consider adding a `docs/` folder with auto‑generated API docs (e.g., with Sphinx or MkDocs) and high‑level explanations.  The cookiecutter template includes docs and emphasises that reports can live in `outputs/reports`; you can adopt a similar strategy for generated maps/figures.



8\. \*\*Testing \& CI\*\* – Add a minimal `tests/` directory with unit tests for critical functions (e.g., verifying that Earth‑Engine image collections are processed correctly, metrics are computed properly).  Use GitHub Actions to run tests automatically.  Pre‑commit hooks can enforce code style.



9\. \*\*Version control and tags\*\* – Tag versions in Git when you make significant changes; this helps reproducibility.  Consider using semantic versioning.



\### Putting it all together



Combining the general Python guidelines with the cookiecutter data‑science structure and patterns from existing LULC projects leads to a maintainable, future‑proof repository.  The project will have a clear separation between:



\* \*\*Core library (`<package\_name>` or `src/`)\*\* – houses algorithms, data loaders and Earth‑Engine wrappers.

\* \*\*User interfaces\*\* – notebooks for exploration and a Streamlit app for interactive use.

\* \*\*Configuration and dependencies\*\* – environment files and config files for reproducibility.

\* \*\*Documentation and testing\*\* – docs and tests to help others understand and validate your work.



Such a structure helps collaborators navigate the codebase, encourages reproducibility and makes it easier to extend the classifier with new models or UI components.
